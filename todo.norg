- ( ) [telescope-fzf-native.nvim]{https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim} for better performance

      or `<leader>e`
- ( ) automatically set `nomodifable` on files in `node_modules` or `.cargo/register`
- ( ) `gl` mapping for local- sope. e.g. `glr` for local references (all references occur in current file)
      extremely useful for "go to all reference in current file"
