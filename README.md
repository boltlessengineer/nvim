# My Neovim config

## How to install Neovim

```bash
brew install neovim # (v0.8.0)

brew install neovim --HEAD # (v0.9.0)
```

## TODOS

- IDEA: time-based theme switch (see: [abzcoding/lvim](https://github.com/abzcoding/lvim/commit/8c3f785d820107cff922360f1626e0d8004d5881#commitcomment-84750112))
- IDEA: diagnostic count & direction indicator on righttop, rightbottom of the buffer window (see: [starsh/everybody-wants-that-line.nvim](https://github.com/strash/everybody-wants-that-line.nvim)

- Important
  - [ ] fix Treesitter/LspHover markdown highlighting issue

- Issue
  - [ ] 'add diffcolumn option' for diff icons in normal buffer

- [ ] replace colorizer with ccc.nvim (more actively maintained)
- [ ] folke/neodev.nvim
- [ ] b0o/schemastore.nvim
- [ ] symbols-outline.nvim | aerial.nvim

- [ ] make `'titlestring'` more useful
- [ ] complete end with `,` if creating list or object's child
- [ ] shorten filename in `Telescope oldfiles` like /o/h/C/n/asdfasdf.txt

- [ ] tree-sitter based commenting (commenting function)

## IDEAS

- [ ] NvimRoot (neovim file manager based on broot)
  - [ ] show total file path on status line (filename)
